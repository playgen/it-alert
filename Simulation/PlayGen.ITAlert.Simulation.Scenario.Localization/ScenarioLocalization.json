{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame1","en-gb":"Welcome to IT Alert!\nYou are a system administrator tasked with keeping your network healthy.\nLet's get started...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame2","en-gb":"Your location is shown by the blue circle.\nTry navigating to another workstation by clicking on it...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame3","en-gb":"Well done. Now you know how to move around the network","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame4","en-gb":"The item that has just spawned on the right is a Scanner.\n\nThe Scanner reveals viruses on a workstation when it is activated.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame5","en-gb":"To use an item you must be at the same workstation...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame6","en-gb":"When you are on workstation available items appear in the tray at the bottom of your screen.\n\nClicking the item on your tray will activate the item...","nl":""},

{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame8","en-gb":"To pick up an item click on your inventory slot, then on the item.\n\nYour inventory slot is on the bottom right, indicated by the suitcase icon.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame9","en-gb":"It's time to investigate!\n\nMake your way to the left workstation..","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame10","en-gb":"You need to use the Scanner to reveal the source of the problem.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame11","en-gb":"Install the item on the current workstation\n\nSelect your inventory and then click on one of the item slots in the panel at the bottom of the screen.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial1_Frame12","en-gb":"You have now revealed the source of the infection.\n\nWe've provided you with the necessary Antivirus, you'll have to figure out the rest on your own...","nl":""},

{"Key":"Tutorial2_Description","en-gb":"This will introduce you to Virus analysis and Antivirus crafting.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame1","en-gb":"This tutorial shows how to analyse Viruses and produce Antivirus to eliminate infections.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame2","en-gb":"The Analysis Workstation is at the bottom of the screen, we'll see how to use it soon.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame3","en-gb":"A Virus has infected the Left Workstation. It's slowing down the Workstation and the connecting network routes. \n\nUse the Scanner to reveal the Virus...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame4","en-gb":"Now that the Virus is revealed you need to obtain a sample for analysis.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame5","en-gb":"To sample the Virus use the Capture tool that's just been installed on the Analysis Workstation. \n\nClick on the Analysis Workstation and once there collect the Capture tool...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame6","en-gb":"You need to drop the Scanner tool first.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame7","en-gb":"Now pick up the Capture tool.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame8","en-gb":"You need to return to the source of the infection to obtain a sample.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame9","en-gb":"Activate the Capture tool to obtain a sample","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame10","en-gb":"Good work. You have obtained a sample of the Red Virus genome\n\nYou need to take the sample to the Analysis Workstation for analysis...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame11","en-gb":"Drop the captured sample on the Microscope and analyse it by activating clicking the DNA icon ","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame12","en-gb":"You have produced an Antivirus that targets the Red Virus genome.\n\nUse it to exterminate the infection on the Left Workstation.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame13","en-gb":"Another Virus has spawned on the Top Workstation. \n\nRepeat the previous process to eliminate the threat.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame14","en-gb":"This is a different type of virus, your Red Antivirus won't work against this.\n\nYou will need to Capture and Analyse it.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame15","en-gb":"Good work! You have eliminated two viruses, however the Right workstation seems to be infected as well\n\nYou know what to do...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame16","en-gb":"This Virus is more sophisticated than the others and combines genes from both the Red and the Green genomes.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame17","en-gb":"Capturing this virus won't work. You'll have to try something else. \n\nHow about one of those Antiviruses you've got lying around...","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial2_Frame18","en-gb":"Using an antivirus on a <Level 2> Virus will eliminate on the gene of that colour\n\nNow it's up to you to do the rest...","nl":""},

{"Key":"Tutorial3_Frame1","en-gb":"This is a much larger network than you've had to maintain before and it is already riddled with infections.\n\nYour colleague has done some of the work already and fully scanned the network, revealing the infections.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial3_Frame2","en-gb":"Viruses consume bandwidth on adjacent connections and reduce your movment speed. \n\nConnections with two adjacent infections are slower than connections with only one.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial3_Frame3","en-gb":"We've provided you with a Green Antivirus but it's on a distant Workstation.\n\nMake your way there and collect it.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial3_Frame4","en-gb":"Your colleague has arrived and has brought a Red Antivirus with them.\n\nFortunately this network is equipped with File Transfer Stations, these provide a fast way of moving items across large distances.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial3_Frame5","en-gb":"Items on Transfer Stations will be exchanged when the system is activated. \n\nDrop the Green Antivirus on the transfer location and activate the upload.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial3_Frame7","en-gb":"Good Work. Now your colleague can get to work dealing with the Green infections while you can handle the Red.","nl":""},

{"Key":"Tutorial4_Description","en-gb":"This will introduce you to advanced Viruses and how to work together to neutralise them.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame1","en-gb":"So far the Viruses we've encountered have been dormant, but if left unchecked they will spread.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame2","en-gb":"When a Virus spreads it creates a copy of itself that will spread along adjacent connections and infect the system it reaches.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame3","en-gb":"A System can only have one infection, when a Virus arrives at an already infected system it will have no effect","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame4","en-gb":"However, when a virus with a different genome attempts to infect a system, the virus will mutate","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame5","en-gb":"This Virus is more sophisticated than the others and combines genes from both the Red and the Green genomes.\n\nLet's try and capture a sample of it for analysis","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame6","en-gb":"We can't capture a sample of a more complicated genome.\n\nSampled will only capture one of the genes that make up the virus.","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame7","en-gb":"To remove this infection you will need Antivirus for all of the constiuent genes.\n\nProduce a red and a green Antivirus and bring them to the infected Workstation","nl":""},
{"Key":"Tutorial4_Frame8","en-gb":"You can't neutralise an advanced virus on your own.\n\nYour colleague has arrived to help you out, you will need to activate the two Antivirus simultaneously.","nl":""},
